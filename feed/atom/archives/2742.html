I recently set up a Joplin Server on my Ubuntu 20.04 system using Docker, and the process was surprisingly smooth. The ability to configure Docker Compose and manage environment variables like APP_BASE_URL and POSTGRES_PASSWORD made the deployment both organized and efficient.For those new to Docker, the first step is to ensure a proper Install Docker on Ubuntu guide. It's a lifesaver for setting up the required Docker environment on your system. Configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy for SSL and secure access further enhance the deployment experience .The default admin account provided (admin@localhost with the password admin) is a thoughtful addition for a quick setup, though it's advisable to change the password immediately for security. If you're looking for a self-hosted solution that combines productivity and privacy , Joplin paired with Docker is a fantastic choice.
