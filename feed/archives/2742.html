<description><![CDATA[Joplin is an impressive open-source note-taking application that's available on all major platforms. What really stands out is its flexibility to support multiple cloud synchronization methods and even the ability to host your own server, offering complete control over your data. I recently set up a Joplin Server on my Ubuntu 20.04 system using Docker, and the process was surprisingly smooth. The ability to configure Docker Compose and manage environment variables like APP_BASE_URL and POSTGRES_PASSWORD made the deployment both organized and efficient.For those new to Docker, the first step is to ensure a proper Install Docker on Ubuntu guide. It's a lifesaver for setting up the required Docker environment on your system. Configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy for SSL and secure access further enhance the deployment experience .The default admin account provided (admin@localhost with the password admin) is a thoughtful addition for a quick setup, though it's advisable to change the password immediately for security. If you're looking for a self-hosted solution that combines productivity and privacy , Joplin paired with Docker is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend exploring the official documentation and GitHub repository for further customization options.]]></description>
